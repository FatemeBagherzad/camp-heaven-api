        'Gorgeous park. Exceptionally well maintained. Quiet, beautiful setting. Keith is the nicest guy and you can tell that people are very happy here. Really easy to work with & just very genuine and kind. Only briefly met his wife but she was also very lovely. Have heard horror stories about other parks and that‚Äôs just not the case here at all. It‚Äôs nothing but good people and awesome management. We just got our seasonal site this year & we‚Äôre looking forward to the years ahead, we feel very lucky to have landed on this place by accident. Called Keith one day when we found this park after a quick Google search, and he really took the time to tell me about the park, and gave us an awesome tour the next day. We were sold. He never makes you feel rushed and clearly wants his campers to be happy. It‚Äôs a good tribe here and you can‚Äôt beat the setting. Big, private sites. Tons of wildlife and greenery. A great spot to unplug, unwind and get reconnected to what‚Äôs important in life.',

        "Needed a place to stay overnight.  Called ahead, and plenty of space available.  Owner is an EXTREMELY friendly guy!  He put us in a nice pull-thru space overnight.  Nice and clean spot in the trees with ponds and a HUGE fenced dog run.  Absolutely wonderful little park to stay a night.  Wish our plans could have accommodated a longer stay. Note: road to the park is rough with a lot of pot holes to avoid.  Owner is not responsible for the weather and rain the area has been getting, but I also would not recommend pulling a 40' camper into this area unless you are staying for an extended period of time.",

        "Had a bad experience with the staff/owner.  We had 4 nights booked and had been quite ill and in the hopsital.  I called the day of arrival just to let them know I wouldn't be coming that night and wasn't sure if we would be making it up for the last few nights.  I was under the impression since I didn't actually tell them we were cancelling that if I started to feel better we could still come up and use our site for that last night or 2.  We were going to use the site the last night and found out the park had rented it to someone else, which seems shady.  Spoke with the office staff about it and emailed the owner and have had no response or resolution in 4 days.",

        'Had a birthday party here that went really well. A great time was had by all. They do not offer party packages fyi. I had arrived early to decorate a couple of picnic tables a bit (about 9:30) and was able to enter no problem. It does not actually open until 10 am. (but that may be for the water park).Luckily, a few of the shelters were not reserved, and I was able to scoop one up for the party. It worked out well because it started absolutely pouring at one point, so we all went into the sheltered area for pizza. There were about 9 picnic tables in the shelter.There were also life guards on duty at all times (while the water park is open).',

The managers Carol and Tom are the only saving grace for this place, super lovely people if you get the chance to introduce yourself.

        "I have been a seasonal resident in the family area for two years, and I love Cedar Beach Resort! Main features for me: close to northeast GTA (30 min drive); lots of children, amenities and events; friendly neighbours; great office and maintenance staff. Great place for children: lots of children, life guarded swimming pool, splash pad, large and small playgrounds, soccer field, beach volleyball courts, badminton court, tennis courts, basketball court, library, small private sandy beach front with free kayaks and paddleboats, park events (movie nights, corn roast, Santa visit in August, Halloween in September), many families have fires in the evening, ..., and many other things that make seasonal residency at Cedar Beach great. Neighbours are friendly and helpful. Admin has been excellent. Season is April 1 to October 31. Municipal electricity, municipal water in/water out to septic, overwintering for trailers/park models, internet through park office or arrange with ISP, pay for day pass for guests (keeps too many friends from visiting ...lol), convenient onsite garbage disposal, firewood purchase, and propane tank exchange/purchase. Laundromat, public showers/washrooms if needed. George's shop! 2 min drive to gas/beer/Tims. 10 min drive to mall. Nearby places for hiking, festivals, and fireworks. Quieter adults-only section. Too many conveniences to mention. Cedar Beach staff, the community, and Georges store  (aka the Coolest Little Ice Cream Shop) all try to make the resort a worry-free and magical place for children to spend their summer vacation. You can't put a price on friendships and memories away from devices. ",

        "First point I would like to make: The cabins are very small and cramped, even for one person staying there. They have a nice little patio outside where you can set up a table and eat meals, but you have to use the sink and bathroom area outside, as the cabins don't have those either. Apart from the cabins, the place is beautiful, peaceful, and tranquil. The people are friendly and helpful, (though often too busy to socialize with properly) there are always games on the lawn, and the lake is lovely to swim in (I came in early June 2023). The Bare Bistro has great food, even with me being vegan, and the clubhouse has a nice art-gallery feel with all its nudist pictures inside. I would like to come back to Bare Oaks, but on a weekend where there is something happening, maybe Body Fest, so that there is more to do and more opportunities to socialize.",

        'The owners, Grant and Peter, are wonderful. They keep the resort looking absolutely beautiful. The Social Committee do an amazing job organizing fun events all summer long. The Rainbow Ridge community is welcoming, generous, and supportive. The Rainbow Ridge is a little piece of heaven.',

        "Such a happy placed filled with amazing people. Love going there whenever I can!! As an update a lot has changed at the Ridge - for the better! New Cabins on top of the hill - and a great food truck addition in case you are just not feeling like cooking! The pond, the pool, the people and the pride. I can't wait to go back again this season! It is always a place I visit at least once a summer - and it never dissapoints!As things start to come back to regular times - can confirm still amazing!",

        'What a Beautiful park, the cleanest bathrooms and showers I‚Äôve ever seen on a campsite! Tanya was so welcoming and even moved our sites so our two families could be next to each other. Definitely family friendly and safe. Beautifully renovated pool and also a clean laundry room. We will definitely be back, thank you! üòä',

        'The area is beautiful but my first impression on one of the owners, she raised her voice at my kid and her friend. My kid and i don‚Äôt have a trailer at this trailer park. i never actually formally met any of the owners and when my kid first ever even heard of her or met her. My kid and her friend were screaming a song with no cuss words or anything and then a car sped by almost hitting her and her friend so she said one cuss word. The quiet time is at 11pm and this was around 8:45 pm and one of the owners raised her voice at my kid and her friend got saying one cuss word not in the property but just off of it. The lady said she could kick them off the property when they would have nowhere to go which is not very fair considering they can‚Äôt even drive anywhere. I would understand if this was a more than one time occurrence but this was the first time it‚Äôs ever happened.',

        'The owners are scammers. Raised rates mid season last year by $650 with no warning and forced everyone to pay or get out. Raised fees close to 50% in 2 years. Everything out of the managers mouths was untruthful. Stay away from Harmony Resorts.',

        'It was a nice place. Decent pool and my little guy had lots of friends to play with but if you want privacy this is not the ideal place. Very friendly and helpful staff. Mostly seasonal people but also friendly. The downfall was my site was in front of a seasonal tenant and the more alcohol consumed the louder it got. Until around 1am. In my case I was up with a 4 year old at 6am so needless to say I was not happy. I get having a good time but it was a bit much.',
